on the course of object-oriented programming by a student at the 
Bauman Moscow State Technical University.

shoot forward at the press of a key. To the right hover asteroids move, which you 
can dodge or shoot down. Occasionally unidentified flying objects  appear, which 
the user can ignore or pick up, randomly earning a bonus or anti-bonus. 

The game ends when a spaceship collides with an asteroids.
